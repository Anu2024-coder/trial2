        Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee,
         developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Tales of 
         Suspense #39 in 1962 (cover dated March 1963) and received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968. Shortly after his creation, 
         Iron Man became a founding member of the superhero team, the Avengers, alongside Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. Iron Man stories,
        individually and with the Avengers, have been published consistently since the character's creation.</p>
